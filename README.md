# Morph for MongoDB

Morph is a PHP library to map between PHP objects and MongoDB Documents

*NOTICE* - I have switched to using namespaces and as such will only support PHP 5.3+, Documentation and wiki are not yet up to date but should be soon. The php5.2
branch contains the older, non-namespaced code.
